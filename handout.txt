Web Development:
URL = Uniform Resource Locator.
HTTPS = HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure. The “language” client & server speak
HTML = HtperText Markup Language.
CSS = Cascading Style Sheets.
IP = Internet Protocol. A unique identifier(“address”) of network devices. 
DNS = Domain Name System. Stores domain IP translation tables.
-We don’t use domain for establishing connection, because every device has IP address but not every device has a domain.
